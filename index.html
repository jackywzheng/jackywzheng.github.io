                a
                web app. Design and managing of implementation concepts will be introduced: User Experience Design

            <dd>This course is a web design and programming course with an emphasis on good planning, interface
                design,
                multimedia, client-side scripting with JavaScript, server-side scripting, and best practices. COMP

                will provide students with a solid understanding about how web applications are constructed and
                deployed. Students will be taught to use client-side RAD tools in order to enhance their
                productivity.
                Students will complete a number of assignments and exams as well as one larger project.</dd>

            <dd>This hands-on course is the foundation for all future programming courses and complements COMP 1536
                and
                COMP 1910. This course introduces the fundamental concepts of programming including design,
                development, testing, debugging simple programs, as well as error-handling, and problem solving.</dd>

                Business Communications 1</dt>
        </a>
        <dd>Information technology professionals spend time each day communicating orally and in writing with
            their
            supervisors, colleagues and clients. As problem-solvers and entrepreneurs in industry, you need to
            communicate quickly, clearly, and effectively. This course will teach you how to be a professional
            and
            efficient communicator at work. You will write effective business correspondence and instructions
            and
            deliver a formal oral presentation to your set. The first term establishes the principles and basic
            patterns on which you will build more advanced applications in the second term.</dd>

                COMP 1712 Biz Analysis and System Design</dt>
        </a>
        <dd>Business Analysis and Systems Design is the study of
            concepts, processes and tools that professionals
            use to plan and develop information systems to industry standards. Students learn how to ask
            implicit
            questions, to create and document communication plans and to make better decisions prior to
            creating a
            software system. Beginning with an introduction to the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC),
            students
            work in teams to initiate the system process, analyze problems, discover requirements and create a
            logical design. </dd>

                1100 CST Program Fundamentals</dt>
        </a>
        <dd>The course covers topics of importance to new and continuing students on how to balance school and
            related activities to enhance chances of success in their academic careers. In this course students
            will learn a variety of different techniques to improve study habits, note taking, and time
            management
            skills. The class will also present other topics of interest to CST students and will introduce
            students to various support systems at BCIT.</dd>

                1113 Applied Mathematics</dt>
        </a>
        <dd>Comp 1113 is partially discrete mathematics, partially an introduction to linear equations. The
            purpose
            of this course is to give a strong foundation for future technical and programming courses. The
            course
            is divided into three parts: (1) Boolean algebra and design of logic circuits; (2) number systems
            and
            data representation; and (3) functions, linear equations, vectors and matrices.</dd>
