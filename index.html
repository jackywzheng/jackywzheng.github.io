                <dt>COMP 1536 Intro to Web Development</dt>
                <dd>This course is a web design and programming course with an emphasis on good planning, interface
                    design,
                    multimedia, client-side scripting with JavaScript, server-side scripting, and best practices. COMP

                    will provide students with a solid understanding about how web applications are constructed and
                    deployed. Students will be taught to use client-side RAD tools in order to enhance their
                    productivity.
                    Students will complete a number of assignments and exams as well as one larger project.</dd>

                    and
                    COMP 1910. This course introduces the fundamental concepts of programming including design,

                <dd>Information technology professionals spend time each day communicating orally and in writing with
                    their
                    supervisors, colleagues and clients. As problem-solvers and entrepreneurs in industry, you need to
                    communicate quickly, clearly, and effectively. This course will teach you how to be a professional
                    and
                    efficient communicator at work. You will write effective business correspondence and instructions
                    and
                    deliver a formal oral presentation to your set. The first term establishes the principles and basic
                    patterns on which you will build more advanced applications in the second term.</dd>

                    COMP 1712 Biz Analysis and System Design</dt>
                <dd>Business Analysis and Systems Design is the study of
                    concepts, processes and tools that professionals
                    use to plan and develop information systems to industry standards. Students learn how to ask
                    implicit
                    questions, to create and document communication plans and to make better decisions prior to
                    creating a
                    software system. Beginning with an introduction to the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC),
                    students
                    work in teams to initiate the system process, analyze problems, discover requirements and create a
                    logical design. </dd>

                    related activities to enhance chances of success in their academic careers. In this course students
                    will learn a variety of different techniques to improve study habits, note taking, and time
                    management
                    skills. The class will also present other topics of interest to CST students and will introduce

                    of this course is to give a strong foundation for future technical and programming courses. The
                    course
                    is divided into three parts: (1) Boolean algebra and design of logic circuits; (2) number systems
                    and
                    data representation; and (3) functions, linear equations, vectors and matrices.</dd>
